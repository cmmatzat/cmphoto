<h2>Nature</h2>
<p>Taking photos of nature, whether my subject is a sweeping landscape, majestic wildlife, or delicate flower, is one of my absolute favorite activities. There is so much natural beauty in this world, and I love that photography allows me to capture that beauty and share it with others.</p>
<p>My nature portfolio showcases some of my personal favorite nature photos. If you are interested in prints, please reach out on my <a class="inline-link" href="/contact">contact page</a> for more information.</p>
